### 🧱 What We Do

We take what the world throws away and turn it into something valuable. Our innovative, AI-driven manufacturing system uses **recycled plastics** to create a range of concrete-based construction materials.

#### ♺ Our Process

1. **Collect**: We gather plastic waste directly from individuals and businesses—charging for waste removal at competitive rates (as low as \$500/ton).
2. **Sort**: Our **robotic sorting system** automates material separation, increasing efficiency and reducing labor costs.
3. **Produce**: The sorted plastics are processed into **eco-concrete** and other **non-structural construction materials** using intelligent, energy-efficient machinery.
4. **Deliver**: We supply concrete and panels to **construction companies**, **landfill managers**, and **green infrastructure developers**.
